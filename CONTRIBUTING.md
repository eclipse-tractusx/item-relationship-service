## Project description

The companies involved want to increase the automotive industry's
competitiveness, improve efficiency through industry-specific cooperation and
accelerate company processes through standardization and access to information
and data. A special focus is also on SMEs, whose active participation is of
central importance for the network's success. That is why Catena-X has been
conceived from the outset as an open network with solutions ready for SMEs,
where these companies will be able to participate quickly and with little IT
infrastructure investment. Tractus-X is meant to be the PoC project of the
Catena-X alliance focusing on parts traceability.

https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit

## Eclipse Dependency License Check

In case of new dependencies or version updates, it might be necessary to have the new library checked and accepted by the Eclipse foundation. Do create new tickets for this, you can use this command:
```
mvn org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check -Ddash.iplab.token=$ECLIPSE_DASH_TOKEN -Ddash.projectId=automotive.tractusx --batch-mode -DskipTests
```

For more information on the tool and how to acquire the token, check https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses.

### Commit messages
The commit messages have to match a pattern in the form of:  
``< type >(scope):[<Ticket_ID>] < description >``  
where type is: `build|chore|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|revert|style|test`

Example:  
``chore(api):[#123] some text``
``chore(api): some text``

Detailed pattern can be found here: [commit-msg](local/development/commit-msg)

#### How to use
```shell
cp local/development/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg && chmod 500 .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

For further information please see https://github.com/hazcod/semantic-commit-hook

### Code formatting 
#### Deprecated soon:
Please use the following code formatter: [.idea/codeStyles](.idea/codeStyles)

#### Upcoming change (not available until whole project base will be formatted to new standard):  
Google Java Format will be used as code format standard.  
Please install `google-java-format` plugin and edit customer VM options (for IntelliJ `Help → Edit Custom VM Options...`) and paste following configuration: 
```
-Xmx4096m
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.code=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.file=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.parser=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.tree=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED
```
The plugin will be disabled by default. To enable it in the current project, go to `File→Settings...→google-java-format` Settings (or `IntelliJ IDEA→Preferences...→Other Settings→google-java-format` Settings on macOS) and check the Enable google-java-format checkbox. (A notification will be presented when you first open a project offering to do this for you.)

### Create a release

1. Choose a release version using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
   and create a corresponding branch according to the template: `chore/prepare-release-x.x.x`.
2. Add release notes for new version in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [charts/irs-helm/CHANGELOG.md](charts/irs-helm/CHANGELOG.md) (e.g. https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/pull/429).
3. Update [COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md](COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md)
4. Create pull request from [release preparation branch to main](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/compare/chore/prepare-release-x.x.x) and merge to main.
5. Create Git tag for the desired release version `git tag x.x.x`
   (the irs-helm tag will be created by the github workflow based on the version in the irs-helm changelog).
6. Push Git tag to repository `git push origin x.x.x`. (Requires eclipse committer role)
7. Wait for release workflow to complete.
8. Merge the automatically opened PR by github-actions bot.
9. Notify about the release in IRS Matrix Chat using the following template: 
   
   >   **IRS Release x.x.x**
   >
   >   IRS version x.x.x is released. 
   >
   >   https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/releases/tag/x.x.x<br>
   >   https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/releases/tag/irs-helm-y.y.y<br>
   >   **Full Changelog:** https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/compare/w.w.w...x.x.x

   _(replace x.x.x with IRS version to release, y.y.y with IRS helm version to release and w.w.w with previous IRS version)_
