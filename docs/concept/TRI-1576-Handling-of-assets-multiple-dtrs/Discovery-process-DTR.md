# \[TRI-1576\] \[CONCEPT\] Handling of assets provided by multiple Digital Twin Registries

## Glossary

| Abbreviation | Name                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| EDC          | Eclipse Dataspace Connector |
| DTR          | Digital Twin Registry       |
| DT           | Digital Twin                |


## Out of scope
This concept does not include the discovery process for EDC notifications. This will be done in a separate concept.

## Scenarios

IRS is not able to validate if a certain data offer is correct or outdated. IRS will take the first responding offer
which is available, all other requests are disregarded after that and the responses are ignored.

### EDC with multiple DTRs

IRS queries all DTRs for the globalAssetId and will take the first result it gets.  
If none of the DTRs return a result, IRS will create a tombstone.

        IRS ->> DTR 2: Query for DT
        DTR 2 ->> IRS: DT
    end

### Multiple EDCs with one DTR

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all registry contract offers in parallel and queries the DTRs for all successful
negotiations.  
The first registry which responds with a DT will be the one used by IRS.

        IRS ->> DTR: Query for DT
        DTR ->> IRS: DT
    end
````

### One EDC with one DTR

Only one EDC found for BPN and the catalog only contains one offer for the DTR.  
IRS will use this registry and will create a tombstone if no DT could be found for the globalAssetId.

### Multiple EDCs with multiple DTRs

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all the registry offers.

        IRS -> EDC Provider 3: Negotiate contract
        IRS ->> DTR: Query for DT
        DTR ->> IRS: No DT
    end
````

### Multiple EDCs with no DTRs

IRS starts a contract negotiation for all the registry offers and creates a tombstone since no DTR could be discovered.

        EDC Provider 3 ->> IRS: No offer
    end
    IRS ->> IRS: Tombstone

## Special Scenarios

### Same DT in multiple DTRs

IRS will use all registries to query for the globalAssetId and takes the first result which is returned.  
If no DT could be found in any of the DTRs, IRS will create a tombstone.

### Multiple DTs (with the same globalAssetId) in one DTRs

IRS uses the /query endpoint of the DTR to get the DT id based on the globalAssetId. If more than one id is present for
a globalAssetId, IRS will use the first of the list.
