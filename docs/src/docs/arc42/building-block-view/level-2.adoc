|AASRecursiveJobHandler
|Recursive job handler for AAS data

|TreeRecursiveLogic
|Retrieves item graphs from potentially multiple calls to IRS API behind multiple EDC Providers, and assembles their outputs into one overall item graph.

|ItemTreesAssembler
|Assembles multiple partial item graphs into one overall item graph.

|BlobPersistence
|Interface for storing data blobs.

== TransferProcessManagement

The TransferProcessManager creates executions and provides them to the executor service. Each execution contains HTTP requests to the asset administration shell registry and to the submodel interface.

|Components |Description

|TransferProcessManager
|The TransferProcessManager manages the requests to the EDC and DigitalTwinRegistry.

|DigitalTwinRegistryFacade
|The DigitalTwinRegistryFacade calls the DigitalTwinRegistry to retrieve data form the AAS registry and transforms the response to internal data models.

|SubmodelFacade
|The SubmodelFacade handles EDC contract negotiations and is responsible for the EDC dataplane requests to retrieve data from the submodel servers.

|BlobStore
|The BlobStore is the database where the relationships and tombstones are stored for a requested item.

|DigitalTwinRegistry
|The DigitalTwinRegistry is the central database of registered assets. In a decentralized network, the registry is no longer central, but every provider has its own registry.

|ExecutorService
|The ExecutorService enables the simultaneous execution of requests of transfer processes.
