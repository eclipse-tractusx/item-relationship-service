|Components |Description

|TransferProcessManager
|The TransferProcessManager manages the requests to the EDC and DigitalTwinRegistry.

|DigitalTwinRegistryFacade
|The DigitalTwinRegistryFacade calls the DigitalTwinRegistry to retrieve data form the AAS registry and transforms the response to internal data models.

|SubmodelFacade
|The SubmodelFacade handles EDC contract negotiations and is responsible for the EDC dataplane requests to retrieve data from the submodel servers.

|BlobStore
|The BlobStore is the database where the relationships and tombstones are stored for a requested item.

|DigitalTwinRegistry
|The DigitalTwinRegistry is the central database of registered assets. In a decentralized network, the registry is no longer central, but every provider has its own registry.

|ExecutorService
|The ExecutorService enables the simultaneous execution of requests of transfer processes.
