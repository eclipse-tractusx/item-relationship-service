|Components |Description

|*IRS*
|The IRS builds a digital representation of a product (digital twin) and the relationships of items the product consists of in a hierarchical structure.

The result is an item graph in which each node represents a digital item of the product - this graph is called "Item Graph".

|*IRS API*
|The *IRS API* is the Interface over which the Data Consumer is communicating.

|*IrsController*
|The *IrsController* provides a REST Interface for retrieving IRS processed data and job details of the current item graph retrieval process.

|*IrsItemGraphQueryService*
|The *IrsItemGraphQueryService* implements the REST Interface of the IrsController.

|*JobOrchestrator*
|The *JobOrchestrator* is a component which manages (start, end, cancel, resume) the jobs which execute the item graph retrieval process.

|*RecursiveJobHandler*
|The *RecursiveJobHandler* handles the job execution recursively until a given abort criteria is reached or the complete item graph is build.

|*TransferProcessManager*
a| The TransferProcessManager handles the outgoing requests to the various data services.
A job is processed in this order:

1. Initiation of the job and preparation of the stream of *DataRequests*
2. *RecursiveJobHandler* requesting for AAS via the Digital Twin registry.
3. Analyzing the structure of the AAS response by collecting the traversal aspect.
4. Requesting submodel data for given items of next level.
5. Recursively iteration over step 2-4 until an abort criterion is reached.
6. Assembles the complete item graph.

|*BlobStore*
|The BlobStore is the database where the relationships and tombstones are stored for a requested item.

|*JobStore*
|The JobStore is the database where the jobs with the information about the requested item are stored.

|*Digital Twin Client*
|The Digital Twin Client is the interface to the Digital Twin Registry. It provides an interface for the Asset Administration Shells.

|*Decentralized Digital Twin Client*
|In a decentralized network, the Digital Twin Client connects to the EDC which then proxies the requests to the digital twin registry on provider side.

|*EDC Client*
|The EDC Client is used to communicate with the EDC network, negotiate contracts and retrieve submodel data.

|*EssController*
|The *EssController* provides a REST Interface to perform BPN investigations of supply chain.

|*PolicyStoreController*
|The *PolicyStoreController* provides a REST Interface for getting, adding and deleting accepted IRS EDC policies. These policies will be used to validate EDC contract offers.
