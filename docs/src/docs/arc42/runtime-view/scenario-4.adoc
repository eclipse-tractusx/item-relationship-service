== Overview

When a user wants to cancel a job execution, the IRS will lookup that job in the persistent job store and transition it to the CANCELED state, if it exists. If a job is canceled, no further requests to the Catena-X network will be performed.

Afterwards, the IRS will return the updated job details of the canceled job to the user.
