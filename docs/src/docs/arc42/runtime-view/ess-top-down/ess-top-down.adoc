= Use Case: ESS (Environmental and Social Standards) Top-Down Approach

With the entry into force of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act as from January 1st, 2023, German companies are obliged to implement the corresponding requirements of this law.
In addition, the following European directives on this subject have also been adopted: EU regulation 2018/858. This regulation is legally binding to all EU member states.

== Specification

This component enables data providers to provide the BoM as planned aspect models via the Catena-X defined solution stack (i.e. EDC).
The BoM as planned aspect models consists of three aspect models:

- PartAsPlanned - Masterdata of a Part Type incl. location related data (e.g. production sites)
- SingleLevelBomAsPlanned - The relation to child part types provided by the supplier of the given company
- PartSiteInformationAsPlanned - Relation to Sites in order to resemble the flow of the specific part/material

=== Step 0: Process initiation

The process is initiated by an ESS incident, that is received by (or created within) the inquiring company.
This ESS incident acts as the root incident for the overall process The incident contains a company name (incl. address) and a valid BPN exists for that company.
The BPN (a BPNL or BPNS) can be looked up in BPDM.

=== Step 1: Check direct suppliers

The inquiring company checks, if the company of the incident is a direct supplier of them.
In order to perform this check, the following data must be available in the inquiring company:

- Full list of direct suppliers
- Full list of parts supplied by those direct suppliers

In case the company of the incident is a direct supplier of the inquiring company, the process ends.
In case the company of the incident is not a direct supplier of the inquiring company, Step 2 is executed.

=== Step 2: Forward Incident

The incident is forwarded to all direct suppliers.
Each direct supplier is sent a "personalized" request to evaluate, if the inquiring company is impacted by the incident.
The incident is enhanced with additional data by the inquiring company:

- List of parts, that are supplied to the inquiring company by their direct supplier.

Each direct supplier executes Step 1.

=== Step 3: Gather Responses

The inquiring company collects the (asynchronous) responses.
The response of each direct supplier may contain the following results;

- YES → The company of the incident was found in the supply chain of the given list of parts
- NO → The company of the incident was not found in the supply chain of the given list of parts
- UNKNOWN → The query timed out or some other error occurred

In case at least one "YES" is received, the process step 3 ends

==== 1. Client Request

The _Client App (Script)_ initiates a request to the IRS (Item Relationship Service) by sending a GET request for shell lookup based on a specific BPN (Business Partner Number).

==== 2. Shell Lookup

IRS, along with other services like DiscoveryFinder, EDCDiscoveryService, and Digital Twin Registry, collaborates to look up shells for the given BPN, returning an array of AAS identifiers.

==== 3. AAS Descriptor Retrieval

For each AAS identifier, the client requests the IRS for the corresponding shell descriptors, adding them to a collection.

==== 4. Filtering AAS

The _Client App (Script)_ filters the AAS collection for SubmodelDescriptors marked _asPlanned_, based on certain criteria.

==== 5. Incident Registration

The client then initiates an IRS incident registration by sending a POST request with specific parameters, including bomLifecycle and callback URL.

==== 6. Incident Handling Loop

IRS proceeds to handle the incident by iterating through AAS identifiers, extracting child CXIds, and performing checks on associated data.

==== 7. Data Validation

The system checks the validity period of the received data and, if valid, proceeds to extract additional information.

==== 8. Incident Response

If certain conditions are met (e.g., incidentBpns contain catenaXsiteId), the system responds to the client indicating a part-chain infection.

==== 9. Notification Handling

Otherwise, the system sends an ess-request notification to the next tier level IRS, and after processing the request on the next tier level, receives an ess-response notification.
