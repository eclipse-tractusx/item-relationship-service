= Quality requirements

The quality scenarios in this section depict the fundamental quality goals as well as other required quality properties. They allow the evaluation of decision alternatives.

- *Quality attribute*: A characteristic of software, or a generic term applying to quality factors, quality subfactors, or metric values.
- *Quality factor*: A management-oriented attribute of software that contributes to its quality.
- *Quality subfactor*: A decomposition of a quality factor or quality subfactor to its technical components.
- *Metric value*: A metric output or an element that is from the range of a metric.
- *Software quality metric*: A function whose inputs are software data and whose output is a single numerical value that can be interpreted as the degree to which software possesses a given attribute that affects its quality.
