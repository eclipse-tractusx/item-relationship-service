## Vision and Mission Statement

"The IRS is providing a technical API Endpoint in the Catena-X Network, which builds an item tree representation of given digital twins stored across the industry. Therefore, it is a key component for the Network to provide data chains along the value chain in the industry."

``The vision for the Item Relationship Service is to provide an easy access endpoint for complex distributed digital twins across Catena-X members.
It abstracts the access from separated digital twins towards a connected data chain of twins and provides those.
It enables to apply business logic on complex distributed digital twins across company borders.``

## What is the IRS?

Within the [Catena-X network](https://catena-x.net/), the so-called Item Relationship Service (IRS) forms an essential
foundation for various services and products. Within the Catena-X use cases, the IRS serves to increase business value.
For example, the IRS provides functionalities to serve requirements, such as occasion-based Traceability,
from the Supply Chain Act. In doing so, IDSA and Gaia-X principles, such as data interoperability and sovereignty, are
maintained on the Catena-X network and access to dispersed data is enabled. Data chains are established as a common
asset.

With the help of the IRS, data chains are to be provided ad-hoc across n-tiers within the Catena-X network.
To realize these data chains, the IRS relies on data models of the Traceability use case and provides the federated
data chains to customers or applications. Furthermore, the target picture of the IRS includes the enablement of new
business areas by means of data chains along the value chain in the automotive industry.

## Usage

### Local deployment

The following subsection provides instructions for running the infrastructure on docker-compose and the application in

### Helm deployment

see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

### Sample calls

#### IRS

Start a job for a globalAssetId:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/irs/jobs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token_value>' \
  -d '{
  "aspects": [
    "SerialPart"
  ],
  "bomLifecycle": "asBuilt",
  "depth": 1,
  "direction": "downward",
  "globalAssetId": "urn:uuid:8a61c8db-561e-4db0-84ec-a693fc5ffdf6"
}'
```

Retrieve the job results by using the jobId returned by the previous call:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8080/irs/jobs/<jobID>' -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token_value>'
```

#### Environmental and Social Standards (ESS)

Start an ESS investigation for a globalAssetId and Incident BPNS.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/ess/bpn/investigations' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token_value>' \
  -d '{
	"key": {
		"globalAssetId": "urn:uuid:3d61ada2-1a50-42a0-b411-40a932dd56cc",
		"bpn": "BPNL00ARBITRARY6"
	},
	"incidentBPNSs": [
		"BPNS00ARBITRARY7"
	],
	"bomLifecycle": "asPlanned"
    }'
```

Retrieve the investigation results by using the jobId returned by the previous call:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8080/ess/bpn/investigations/<jobID>' -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token_value>'
```
